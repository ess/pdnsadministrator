== PDNS-Admin ==
-------------------------------

=== Installation ===
 1. Upload all files, overwriting any existing files

 2. If your server allows it, CHMOD the following files and directories to 755
    or, if you have problems, 777.

    ./skins/
    ./packages/
    ./settings.php

 3. Go to the install directory in your browser
 4. Follow the instructions
 5. Delete the install directory

=== Upgrading ===

 Upgrading is done in the same way as installing. Make sure you select the
 "upgrade" option. Before upgrading, make a note of your current PDNS-Admin
 installation version: you will need it to correctly upgrade. This information
 should be available from the AdminCP of your existing install.

 It is recommended you keep old settings.php. Do not overwrite it as you do
 with other files

=== Requirements ===

 PDNS-Admin works with PHP 4.3.0 or higher. PHP 5 is also supported.
 MySQL 3.22 or higher is required. PDNS-Admin works on any operating
 system and web server combination.

 If you experience a problem and you meet these requirements, please report it
 as a bug. The latest versions of PHP and MySQL are recommended to keep
 PDNS-Admin running its fastest and safest.
